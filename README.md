# Xerobot
Action copying robotic arm

---

## Abstract
In today’s growing industrial world the things are involving more newer and powerful technology equipment. In this world of growing technology, every aspect of human life is involving robotics and automation in it. New companies are also focusing on making the product which will help the human life easier and will involve the less human efforts. Robotics is entering into the household purposes in this new world. Robotics is right now an inseparable part of the industries and will get similar expansion with household use in coming years. The robotics available right is involving the preprogrammed aspects but now the evolving technologies are involving self-programmable or also called autonomous operation. However the autonomous operation doesn’t involve the actual copying of the things. XEROBOT is the new concept which will change the human life to the next level. XEROBOT is a human action copying robot, it performs in the same way as taught by mentor or the operator. While XEROBOT can be a next step ahead in the world it’s uses cannot be limited at certain extent. This report gives the glimpse of the prototype of the XEROBOT and its operation.
